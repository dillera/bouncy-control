# XcodeBuildMCP Best Practices

## Always Use MCP Tools
Never use raw xcodebuild commands. Always use the appropriate MCP tool:
- Building: `mcp__xcodebuildmcp__build_sim_name_proj`
- Testing: `mcp__xcodebuildmcp__test_sim_name_proj`
- Running: `mcp__xcodebuildmcp__build_run_sim_name_proj`
- Package operations: `mcp__xcodebuildmcp__swift_package_*`

## Context-Aware Tool Selection
The context detection script automatically determines which tools to use based on your current directory.
